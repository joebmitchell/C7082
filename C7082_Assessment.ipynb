        "## 1. Background\n",
        "\n",
        "There are approximately 124 million broiler chickens in the UK and 14 million laying hens. Chickens have one of the highest feed converion efficiencies of all farmed animals and provide a large proportion of the UK's animal protein. Commercial production is based on very fine margins and so any ineffiencies must be minimised other profitability is rapidly reduced. As such these birds are kept to very high health standards and any suspicion of disease must be rapidly investigated in order to impliment the correct control measures.\n",
        "Three such diseases that are of concern to the international poultry industry are:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Newcastle disease :  This is a viral disease that can cause a wide variety of symptoms including high mortality, diarrhoea and respiratory distress. It is potentially zoonotic, although normally very mild. It hasn't been confirmed in the UK since 2006 and is a notificable disease.\n",
        "2.   Salmonella : This is a bacterial disease, that can cause minor symptoms in chickens including weakness and diarrhoea. It of most note though because it is zoonotic and may cause serious illness in humans through contaminated meat or eggs.\n",
        "3. Coccidiosis: This is a protozoal disease of birds that unlike the previous two is not zoonotic but can cause serious disease in flocks. Its main symptoms are severe diarrhoea, high mortaltily and reduced intakes and production.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of note with all these diseases is that they can cause diarrhoea in birds. At the minute when changes to faecal consistency is noted in flocks extensive microbiological testing is performed in order to identify the cause. This process takes at least 24hours normally and so if there were a way to speed up diagnosis it would allow for corrective action to be taken sooner minimising the impact. \n",
        "\n",
        "Artifical inteligence and deep learning has been used previously to try and identify the disease a chicken is suffering from using pictures of the bird (Quach et al. 2022) with an accuracy of 94%. This idea is explored further in this paper by testing if a model can be developed that can identify if newcastle disease (NCD), salmonella or coccidiosis is present or if the animal was healthy by using pictures of the birds faeces. \n",

        "A 94% accuracy in diagnosing disease in pictures of chicken faeces has the potential to provide a rapid diagnosis of disease. This would allow swift measures to be put in place to control the disease. As the accuracy of this test isn't perfect it would be sensible to implement this model as a screening test for disease which requires further conformatory testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model training process may have yielded better results if a more formal hyperparameter seach method including an element of randomisation was included (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012) instead of the stepwise model hyperparameter determiniation ustilised in the development of this model. \n",
        "\n",
        "Image augmentation use could also have been tested to see which options to include would have yielded the best results. Furthermore to reduce the impact of the uneven data sizes before training the model, the smaller image categories could have been supplemented by using augmentation to generate new images.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are other diseases that can cause changes to faeces in poutry which this model hasn't been trained on which would likely reduced the accuracy further. The imbalance in the dataset also has the potential to have impacted the training of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model that was trained has achived reasonable accuracy on images that it hasn't been trained on, although this must be tempered with the knowledge that the images in the test dataset are still from the same original dataset. In order to further test this model a new set of images should be gathered from other sources as at the minute it is possible that this model is only useful for diagnosing disease in chickens from the specific locations that these images were taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is also possible that these images may include some other clues as to what disease is present such as features in the background that the model has been trained to identify but these features may not be present in images gathered from other management systems or countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary the model has reasonable accuracy on the images in this dataset and could be used as a screening test for some clinical diseases of chickens although further real world validation would be required before this could be relied on."
